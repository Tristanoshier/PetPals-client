# PetPals
#### PetPals is a social media application that is purely focused on pet content. This is a judgement free zone where you can get on and look at other peoples pets and share pictures of your own. You can can also specify if you are putting up your pets for adoption so you can give them to a safe home.

# Motivation
#### This was our first attempt at building a social media application. Since we all really love our animals, this made development really fun and we really enjoyed building many of the features. 

# Build Status
#### Theres a lot that we wanted to do for this project but we had to consider it finished at this point. Desktop experience is a lot faster than mobile but the mobile experience still works great for viewing your feed. 

# Code style
#### js-standard-style

# Tech/Framework used
#### Built the server side with Node.js and the client side with Legacy React and Typescript. The Application is deployed to Heroku with a cloud instance of Postgres.
