# PetPals
PetPals is a social media application that is purely focused on pet content. This is a judgement free zone where you can get on and look at other peoples pets and share pictures of your own. You can can also specify if you are putting up your pets for adoption so you can give them to a safe home.

# Motivation
This was our first attempt at building a social media application. Since we all really love our animals, this made development really fun and we really enjoyed building many of the features. 

Theres a lot that we wanted to do for this project but we had to consider it finished at this point. Desktop experience is a lot faster than mobile but the mobile experience still works great for viewing your feed. 

# Code style
js-standard-style

# Tech/Framework used
Built the server side with Node.js and the client side with Legacy React and Typescript. The Application is deployed to Heroku with a cloud instance of Postgres.

# Installation 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
